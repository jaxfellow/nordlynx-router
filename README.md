# Linux based NordVPN router

**I created this to help others build and configure their own whole-network router using NordVPN**

The idea is to be able to use the native linux app for NordVPN to create a whole-network vpn router. So far I have been able to get this working on Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora.
